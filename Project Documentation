1 . Introduction
The Daily Habit Tracker is a simple console-based Python application designed to help users log, monitor, and review their daily habits. It encourages consistency and accountability by tracking habit completion over time. This project demonstrates foundational programming skills in Python, including functions, loops, conditionals, and data structures.

2. Objective
To develop a lightweight, user-friendly tool that enables users to record their habits daily and visualize their progress effectively.

3. Approach
A modular design with clear function separation:

add_habit() to input new habits and their completion status.

view_habits() to display all logged habits with statuses.

main() to provide a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

Data is stored in a list of dictionaries for structured habit management.

User inputs are validated for consistency, and the program loops until the user exits.

4. Implementation
Developed in Python 3 with no external dependencies.

Console I/O interaction to minimize complexity and dependencies.

Basic error handling for invalid inputs.

Example data structure for habits:

python
habits = [  
  {'date': '2025-11-21', 'habit': 'Study for 2 hours', 'completed': True},  
  {'date': '2025-11-21', 'habit': 'Gym workout', 'completed': False}  
]  
Menu options include adding habits, viewing habits, and exiting.

The code follows best practices for readability and modularity.

5. Results
Successfully records habit entries with date and completion status.

Displays habit log clearly with indices and statuses.

Maintains data only during runtime (no persistent storage implemented).

Enables users to easily track and review their daily habits.

6. Analysis and Future Work
Strengths:

Simple design focused on core learning objectives.

Provides practical experience with Python data structures and flow control.

Limitations:

Data is not saved between sessions (could improve with file or database storage).

No user authentication or personalized profiles.

Future Enhancements:

Adding persistent storage with files or databases.

Implementing reminders or notifications.

Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) or web app front end.

Providing analytics like habit streaks and success rates.

7. Conclusion
The Daily Habit Tracker serves as a foundational programming project that effectively integrates core programming constructs while providing real-world utility in habit monitoring. It sets a base for further development to more sophisticated personal productivity tools.
